							<h1>Tesla Model S Plaid</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/tesla plaid.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>With a manufacturer quoted 0-60mph time of 1.99 seconds and a ¼ mile time of 9.23 seconds, the Tesla Model S Plaid holds the accolade of being the quickest accelerating production vehicle in the world. The revolutionary all-electric sedan by the American manufacturer has undergone a few changes with the new Plaid model, which hope to make it stand out among the Porsche Tycan’s and Audi RS e-tron Gt’s of the world.</p>
							<p>Compared with the regular dual-motor Model S, the Model S plaid has a Tri-motor setup. Paired with the all-wheel drive setup, the sedan produces a peak power output of 1020 horsepower. The EPA estimated range of 396 miles is a 9-mile deficit when compared to the regular model. Optimized aerodynamics, refined styling and performance wheels and tires are sure to differentiate the Plaid from the regular Model S.</p>
							<p>The most stunning new feature introduced with the Plaid model is undoubtably the introduction of the yoke steering wheel. This bold new feature has been introduced with the goal of improving the visibility of the driver. This revolutionary feature is set to make its way into future Tesla models as well.</p>
							<p>The Model S Plaid is available from $129,740 USD</p>
